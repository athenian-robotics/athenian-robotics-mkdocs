## Hours Tracking App

To get started:

1. Keep this page open in your browser while executing the next 3 steps. This registration is a one-time process.
2. Create a Retool user account [here](https://login.retool.com/auth/signup).
   **DO NOT fill in your name and email information!!!**
   Instead, click on "Sign in with Google" and make sure you use your *athenian.org* email address.
3. When prompted to "Select a team to join" select **pambrose@athenian.org**. You can ignore the resulting page.
4. Go to the [desktop](https://arc852.retool.com/apps/Hours%20Tracker%20App/User%20Registration)
   version of the app and register yourself under "User Registration."

Once registered, you can enter your hours with the desktop or mobile versions of the app:

* [Desktop](https://arc852.retool.com/apps/Hours%20Tracker%20App/Hours%20Tracker)
* [Mobile](https://arc852.retool.com/apps/Hours%20Tracker%20App/Mobile%20Hours%20Tracker)

We are tracking start/end times to assist with contact tracing efforts. So please enter accurate times.

The app does not validate a couple bad input combinations:

1. End time before Start time.
2. Overlapping time spans.
